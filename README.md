# EcomTest - ECommerce API
A base for an Ecommerce web API, for Order Creation only

## Notes

This is an attempt at an Ecommerce API, for creating Orders only. The following gives a summary of future considerations to make it an effective codebase:
- I had some issues updating the stock when the Order / Customer / OrderItems are committed as one. It works but could be better designed to allow EF to take care of this alongside of adding the Order.
-	Mappings - all DTOs in same namespace for my auto automapper mapper routine
-	Concurrency â€“ added TimeStamp, one for the future
-	Scope is set at (mostly) public, need to go through and rethink
-	Not had chance to add documentation tags to all methods
-	Other general considerations that need to be taken on board in future, e.g.
-	  CORS
-	  Auth
-	  Localisation
-	  Testing
-	  Caching
-	  Monitoring
